            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Within a short period, the Internet and World Wide Web have become ubiquitous, surpassing all other technological developments in our history. They've also grown rapidly in their scope and extent of use, significantly affecting all aspects of our lives. Industries such as manufacturing, travel and hospitality, banking, education, and government are Web-enabled to improve and enhance their operations. E-commerce has expanded quickly, cutting across national boundaries. Even traditional legacy information and database systems have migrated to the Web. Advances in wireless technologies and Web-enabled appliances are triggering a new wave of mobile Web applications. As a result, we increasingly depend on a range of Web applications. Now that many of us rely on Web based systems and applications, they need to be reliable and perform well. To build these systems and applications, Web developers need a sound methodology, a disciplined and repeatable process, better development tools, and a set of good guidelines. The emerging field of Web engineering fulfils these needs. It uses scientific, engineering, and management principles and systematic approaches to successfully develop, deploy, and maintain high-quality Web systems and applications. It aims to bring the current chaos in Web based system development under control, minimize risks, and enhance Web site maintainability and quality.</p>

            <h2>Web Crisis</h2>
            <p>Although numerous Web-based systems are in use now, the manner in which they're developed, deployed, and managed raises serious concerns (see the sidebar, “Problems of Web-Based Systems Development: A Diagnosis”). Web developers often use ad hoc, hacker-type approaches, which lack rigor, systematic techniques, sound methodologies, and quality assurance.</p>
            <p>The current problems surrounding Web-based system development partially result from the continuing advances in Internet and Web technologies, the increase in commercial Web applications, the frantic rush to be on the Web, and the need to quickly migrate legacy systems to Web environments.</p>
            <p>Poorly developed Web-based applications that continue to expand have a high probability of low performance and/or failure. Recently, large Web-based systems have had an increasing number of failures (many of them weren't publicly acknowledged or documented). In certain classes of applications such as supply-chain management, tendering and procurement, financial services, and emerging digital hubs or marketplaces, a system failure can propagate broad-based problems across many functions, causing a major Web disaster. The cost of bad design, shabby development, poor performance, and/or lack of content management for Web-based applications have many serious consequences.</p>
            <p>A recent survey on Web-based project development by the Cutter Consortium (reported in its Research Briefs, 7 Nov. 2000) highlighted problems plaguing large Web-based projects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Delivered systems didn't meet business needs 84 percent of the time.</li>
                <li>Schedule delays plagued the projects 79 percent of the time.</li>
                <li>Projects exceeded the budget 63 percent of the time.</li>
                <li>Delivered systems didn't have the required functionality 53 percent of the time.</li>
                <li>Deliverables were of poor quality 52 percent of the time.</li>
            </ul>
